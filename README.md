## Final Project

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The objective is to design and implement a dynamic website of my own.

This web site was built in Django for the final project.
My project is about a blog where you can create post, edit the post you create, delete those post (the onces you create), leave a comment on another post and search for publish posts on the web site MY BLOG.
